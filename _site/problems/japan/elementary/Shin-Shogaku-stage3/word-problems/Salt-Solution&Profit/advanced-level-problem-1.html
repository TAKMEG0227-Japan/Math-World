<p>Container A contains some amount of pure salt.
Container B contains 100g of 20% salt solution.
Water is added at a constant rate into container A.</p>

<p>After 4 seconds, the solution in A becomes 20% salt.
Water is then added until the solution in A becomes 10% salt, and then stopped.</p>

<p>(1) How many seconds after starting the water addition was it stopped?</p>

<p>(2) After that, 100g of A’s solution is transferred to B, and after mixing, 50g is returned to A.
As a result, the amount of salt in A and B becomes equal.
How much salt was originally in container A?</p>
