<p>“Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!”</p>

<p>Container A initially contains 600g of salt solution (unknown concentration).
Container B contains salt solution of 18% concentration (amount unknown).</p>

<p>Step 1:
Transfer 200g from A to B, mix well. After mixing, B’s concentration becomes 16%.</p>

<p>Step 2:
Transfer 200g back from B to A.
Add 80g of water to A and mix well. Then, A’s final concentration becomes 10%.</p>

<p>Questions:
(1) How many grams of salt are in the final 10% solution in A?</p>

<p>(2) What was the original concentration (%) of the salt solution in A?</p>

<p>(3) How much solution (g) was in container B at the beginning?</p>
