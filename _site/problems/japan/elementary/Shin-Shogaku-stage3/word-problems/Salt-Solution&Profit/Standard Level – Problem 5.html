<p>“Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!”</p>

<p>A store bought 50 items.
Each item was priced with a 50% profit added to the cost price.
Only 20% of the items were sold at the original price.
The remaining 80% were sold at half the list price during a bargain sale.
After selling all 50 items this way, the store incurred an 800 yen loss.</p>

<p>(1) If the cost price of one item is 1,
what is the total revenue from selling all 50 items?</p>

<p>(2)Given that the total loss was 800 yen,
what is the cost price of one item in yen?</p>
