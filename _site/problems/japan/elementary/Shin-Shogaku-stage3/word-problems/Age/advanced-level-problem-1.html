<p>“Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!”</p>

<p>Currently, there are five family members: father, mother, grandfather, myself, and my younger sister.
The total sum of their ages is 193 years.
The father is 4 years older than the mother.
I am 2 years older than my younger sister.
The grandfather is 7 times as old as the younger sister.
In 5 years, the sum of the father’s and mother’s ages will be 3 times the sum of mine and my sister’s ages.</p>

<p>Let’s find:</p>

<p>(1) How much is the mother’s age minus 3 times the younger sister’s age?</p>

<p>(2) How much is my age plus my grandfather’s age?</p>

<p>(3) What is the ratio of the mother’s age to the younger sister’s age?</p>
