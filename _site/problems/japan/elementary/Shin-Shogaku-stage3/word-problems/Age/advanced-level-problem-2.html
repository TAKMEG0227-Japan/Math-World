<p>“Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!”</p>

<p>Currently, my family consists of four people: my father, mother, myself, and my younger brother.</p>

<p>The sum of our ages is 102 years.
My mother is 37 years old.
Five years ago, my grandmother was alive, and the sum of the five family members’ ages was 147 years.
Ten years ago, my younger brother was not yet born, and the sum of the other 4 people’s ages was 123 years.
In 7 years, my father’s age will be 2.5 times my age at that time.
We are to find:</p>

<p>(1) What was my grandmother’s age 5 years ago?
(2) What is my younger brother’s current age?
(3) What is my father’s current age?
