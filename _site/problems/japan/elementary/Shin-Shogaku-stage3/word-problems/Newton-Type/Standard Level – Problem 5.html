<p>“Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!”</p>

<p>A stadium has 10 gates, and each gate allows 15 people per minute to enter.</p>

<p>At 5:00 p.m., there was already a line of 2,400 people,
and the line was increasing by 50 people per minute.</p>

<p>At that time, only 6 gates were opened to start letting people in.</p>

<p>At 5:10 p.m., the queue became ① people,
but after that, the number of people joining the line increased to 100 per minute.</p>

<p>So, all 10 gates were opened at that point.
The queue was completely gone by 5:② p.m.</p>

<p>Question:
What numbers go in ① and ②?</p>
