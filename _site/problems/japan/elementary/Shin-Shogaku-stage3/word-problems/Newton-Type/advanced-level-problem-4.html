<p>“Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!”</p>

<p>At an amusement park, people gather in the square in front of the entrances at a rate of 3 people every 2 seconds,
which equals 90 people per minute.</p>

<p>One day, many people had already gathered in front of the entrance.</p>

<p>To deal with the crowd, the number of entrances was increased from 6 to 8.
As a result, after 45 minutes, the crowd disappeared.</p>

<p>Then, the entrances were reduced back to 6, and
15 minutes later, the same number of people had gathered again as at the beginning.</p>

<p>Each entrance allows the same number of people per minute to enter.</p>

<p>Questions:
(1) How many people can one entrance allow in per minute?</p>

<p>(2) How many people had gathered at the beginning?</p>
