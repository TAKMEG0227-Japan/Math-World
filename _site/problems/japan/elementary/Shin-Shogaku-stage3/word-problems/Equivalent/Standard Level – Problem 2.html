<p>“Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!”</p>

<p>Eiji went to a stationery store.</p>

<p>He bought 4 notebooks for a price that was 80 yen more than half of the money he had.</p>

<p>After that, the money he had left was 2/5 of what he originally had.</p>

<p>Questions:
(1) How much money did Eiji have at first?</p>

<p>(2) What was the price of one notebook?</p>
