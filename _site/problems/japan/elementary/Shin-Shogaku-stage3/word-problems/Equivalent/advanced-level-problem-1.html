<p>There are two balls, A and B:</p>

<p>Ball A bounces back to 1/3 of the height it was dropped from.
Ball B bounces back to 1/2 of the height it was dropped from.
Both balls are dropped from the same initial height.</p>

<p>After bouncing once, falling again, and bouncing a second time,
the difference in their rebound heights (at the second bounce) is 25 cm.</p>

<p>Question:
What was the original height from which they were dropped?
