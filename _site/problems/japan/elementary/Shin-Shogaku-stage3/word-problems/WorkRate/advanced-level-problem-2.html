<p>“Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!”</p>

<p>There is a water tank with three valves, A, B, and C.</p>

<p>Valves A and B are located at the bottom of the tank,
 so they can drain the entire tank.
Valve C is located on the side,
 so it can only drain 70% of the tank’s volume.
Draining times:</p>

<p>A alone: 15 minutes to drain the full tank
B alone: 30 minutes to drain the full tank
C alone: 42 minutes to drain 70% of the tank
Initially, the tank is completely full.</p>

<p>Questions:
(1) If valves A and B are opened at the same time, how many minutes will it take to drain the tank?</p>

<p>(2) If all three valves A, B, and C are opened together, how many minutes will it take to drain the tank?</p>
