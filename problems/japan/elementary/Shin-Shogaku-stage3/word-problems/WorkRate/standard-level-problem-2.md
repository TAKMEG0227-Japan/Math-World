# 🧮 Standard Problem 2 

"Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!"

To copy a document:

A takes 100 minutes
B takes 80 minutes

They work in two phases:
First, A and B work together for 20 minutes
Then, B and C continue working together until the task is complete

Questions:
(1) How many minutes did B and C work together?

(2) How much of the total task did B copy?
