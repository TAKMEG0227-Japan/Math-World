# 🧮 Standard Problem 5

"Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!"

A stadium has 10 gates, and each gate allows 15 people per minute to enter.

At 5:00 p.m., there was already a line of 2,400 people,
and the line was increasing by 50 people per minute.

At that time, only 6 gates were opened to start letting people in.

At 5:10 p.m., the queue became ① people,
but after that, the number of people joining the line increased to 100 per minute.

So, all 10 gates were opened at that point.
The queue was completely gone by 5:② p.m.

Question:
What numbers go in ① and ②?
