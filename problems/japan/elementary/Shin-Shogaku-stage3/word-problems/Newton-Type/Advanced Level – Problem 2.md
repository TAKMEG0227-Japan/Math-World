# 🧮 Advanced Problem 2

"Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!"

There is a pasture full of grass.
Grass grows at a constant rate each day.

If:
85 sheep graze, they eat all the grass in 20 weeks
110 sheep graze, they eat all the grass in 15 weeks
Each sheep eats the same amount of grass per day, and
the amount of grass grown is constant.

Questions:
(1) Let 1 sheep’s weekly consumption = 1 unit.
Then, how much grass grows per week?

(2) If 130 sheep graze for 10 weeks, then some are removed,
and the remaining sheep eat all the grass in 6 more weeks,
how many sheep were moved?
