# 🧮 Advanced Problem 4

"Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!"

At an amusement park, people gather in the square in front of the entrances at a rate of 3 people every 2 seconds,
which equals 90 people per minute.

One day, many people had already gathered in front of the entrance.

To deal with the crowd, the number of entrances was increased from 6 to 8.
As a result, after 45 minutes, the crowd disappeared.

Then, the entrances were reduced back to 6, and
15 minutes later, the same number of people had gathered again as at the beginning.

Each entrance allows the same number of people per minute to enter.

Questions:
(1) How many people can one entrance allow in per minute?

(2) How many people had gathered at the beginning?
