# 🧮 Advanced Problem 3

"Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!"

There is a well where water springs at a constant rate.

Water is pumped out using pumps that all have the same performance.

When 5 pumps are used for 20 minutes, half of the initial water remains.
Then, using only 3 pumps for another 40 minutes, the well becomes empty.

Question:
If you use 6 pumps from the beginning, in how many minutes will the well be empty?
