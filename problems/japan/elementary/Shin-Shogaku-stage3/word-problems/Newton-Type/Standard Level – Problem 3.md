# 🧮 Standard Problem 3

"Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!"

At a movie theater ticket counter:

When sales begin, there are 150 people already in line
After that, 5 more people join the line every minute
If only one ticket window is open, the entire line disappears in 30 minutes.

Question:
If there were two ticket windows, how many minutes would it take for the line to disappear?
