# 🧮 Advanced Problem 1 

There are two balls, A and B:

Ball A bounces back to 1/3 of the height it was dropped from.
Ball B bounces back to 1/2 of the height it was dropped from.
Both balls are dropped from the same initial height.

After bouncing once, falling again, and bouncing a second time,
the difference in their rebound heights (at the second bounce) is 25 cm.

Question:
What was the original height from which they were dropped?
