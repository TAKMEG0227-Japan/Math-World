A store receives orders and produces products upon request.
Each product is sold at 40% profit over its cost price.
The store also pays a fixed monthly rent (same every month).

(1) In February:
Orders increased by 60% compared to January
 → February orders = 1,200 units

Profit after subtracting cost and rent increased by 180% compared to January

(2) In March:
Orders increased by 50% over February
Net profit (after cost and rent) was 520,000 yen
