# 🧮 Advanced Problem 2

"Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!"

Container A initially contains 600g of salt solution (unknown concentration).
Container B contains salt solution of 18% concentration (amount unknown).

Step 1:
Transfer 200g from A to B, mix well. After mixing, B's concentration becomes 16%.

Step 2:
Transfer 200g back from B to A.
Add 80g of water to A and mix well. Then, A's final concentration becomes 10%.

Questions:
(1) How many grams of salt are in the final 10% solution in A?

(2) What was the original concentration (%) of the salt solution in A?

(3) How much solution (g) was in container B at the beginning?
