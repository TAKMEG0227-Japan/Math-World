# 🧮 Standard Problem 3

"Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!"

To transport all the items from a warehouse:

Truck B needs 15 trips
Truck C needs 12 trips

Questions:

(1)
If Truck A would take 9 trips to carry a certain load,
how many trips would it take if Trucks B and C work together?

(2)
All 3 trucks (A, B, and C) make 2 trips together,
then the remaining items are carried by B and C.

How many more trips (with B and C together) are needed to complete the job?
