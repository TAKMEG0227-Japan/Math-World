# 🧮 Advanced Problem 2

"Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!"

Two pipes, A and B, are used to fill a water tank.
In the first case, the tank is filled with 6,500 liters of water in 1 hour.

Next, the flow rate of pipe A is increased by 7%, and the flow rate of pipe B is increased by 12%.
With this increase, the tank receives 7,205 liters in 1 hour.

(1) How many liters of water did each pipe, A and B, originally deliver per hour?

(2) If the flow rate of A is increased by 50% from the original, and the total water is still 6,500L in one hour,
by what percentage should B’s original rate be decreased?
