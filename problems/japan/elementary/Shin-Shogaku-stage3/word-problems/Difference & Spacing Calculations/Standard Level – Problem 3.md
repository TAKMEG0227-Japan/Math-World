# 🧮 Standard Problem 3

"Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!"

Some number of children are to receive ohajiki (game pieces).
If 8 pieces are given to each child, there aren't enough for 2 children.

If instead, 6 pieces are given to each child, there are enough pieces for 3 extra children.

How many ohajiki are there in total?
