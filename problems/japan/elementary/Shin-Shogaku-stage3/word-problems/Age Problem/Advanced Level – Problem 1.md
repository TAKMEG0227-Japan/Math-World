# 🧮 Advanced Problem 1 

"Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!"

Currently, there are five family members: father, mother, grandfather, myself, and my younger sister.
The total sum of their ages is 193 years.
The father is 4 years older than the mother.
I am 2 years older than my younger sister.
The grandfather is 7 times as old as the younger sister.
In 5 years, the sum of the father’s and mother’s ages will be 3 times the sum of mine and my sister’s ages.

Let’s find:

(1) How much is the mother’s age minus 3 times the younger sister’s age?

(2) How much is my age plus my grandfather’s age?

(3) What is the ratio of the mother’s age to the younger sister’s age?
