# 🧮 Advanced Problem 3

"Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!"

A store set the list price of an item by increasing the cost price by 40%.

When the item was sold, the store offered a 20% discount off the list price,
and then subtracted an additional 80 yen,
resulting in a final profit of 8% of the cost price.

(1) What percentage of the cost price is 20% of the list price?

(2) What is the cost price of the item (in yen)?

(3) How many yen below the list price was the item sold for?
