# 🧮 Standard Problem 5

"Try to solve it using only elementary school knowledge!"

A store bought 50 items.
Each item was priced with a 50% profit added to the cost price.
Only 20% of the items were sold at the original price.
The remaining 80% were sold at half the list price during a bargain sale.
After selling all 50 items this way, the store incurred an 800 yen loss.

(1) If the cost price of one item is 1,
what is the total revenue from selling all 50 items?

(2)Given that the total loss was 800 yen,
what is the cost price of one item in yen?
