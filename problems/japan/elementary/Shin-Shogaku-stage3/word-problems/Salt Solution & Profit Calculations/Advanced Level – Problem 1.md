# 🧮 Advanced Problem 1 

Container A contains some amount of pure salt.
Container B contains 100g of 20% salt solution.
Water is added at a constant rate into container A.

After 4 seconds, the solution in A becomes 20% salt.
Water is then added until the solution in A becomes 10% salt, and then stopped.

(1) How many seconds after starting the water addition was it stopped?

(2) After that, 100g of A's solution is transferred to B, and after mixing, 50g is returned to A.
As a result, the amount of salt in A and B becomes equal.
How much salt was originally in container A?
